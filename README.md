  ## Description
  This is a prototype of a real-word online store that not only let clients to buy itmes online and pay using PayPal, but also have admin features that gives the admin full control over all aspects of this online store including the creation, update and deletion of items from the database on the server. The app was created using the full capabilities of MERN stack and uses MongoDB as its databse, Express JS as its server, React as its Javascript library to build its UI and Node.js as its backend environment as core technologies. I have also used various npm packages including bcryptjs, json web token and express async handler. The css styling is based on bootstrap.

You can also view your oder history and whether or not you have paid for the orders you have placed or they have been delivered or not. Future improvements to client section will include adding the ability to write reviews and rate products. As an admin though, you have access to extra features including the ability to see the entire inventory of item, edit the items in server databse, create new items and add them to the databse and delete items from databse. Admin section is a work in progress and currently supports the mentioned capabilities.
